            "description": "Van Gogh produced more than twenty self-portraits during his Parisian sojourn (1886-88). Short of funds but determined nevertheless to hone his skills as a figure painter, he became his own best sitter: 'I purposely bought a good enough mirror to work from myself, for want of a model.' This picture, which shows the artist's awareness of Neo-Impressionist technique and color theory, is one of several that are painted on the reverse of an earlier peasant study.",

            "date": "ca. 1479â€“1458 B.C.",
            "description": "This fragmentary sphinx represents the female pharaoh Hatshepsut. Portions of six granite sphinxes were discovered during the Museum's excavations in the area of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri in Western Thebes. A nearly complete example is on display in gallery 131. This sphinx still retains substantial blue paint on the royal beard, traces of yellow paint on the pleats of the nemes-headcloth, and small amounts of paint around the eyes. A smaller sphinx in a different style is also owned by the Museum.",
